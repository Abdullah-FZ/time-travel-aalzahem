Welcome to the *Time Travel Zine*!  
In this little project, I’m exploring the idea of a **time machine** — how it could work, what could go wrong, and why people have always been fascinated by time travel.  
From old sci-fi stories to real scientific theories, this zine looks at how we imagine moving through time.  
It’s a short, fun way to think about what it might be like to visit the past or the future.
This keeps the required phrase “time machine” while sounding natural, like something a student would write for a lab assignment.
