Why This File Is Ignored
The `.gitignore` file tells Git to ignore the `Lab` folder so temporary or personal work files donâ€™t get uploaded to the repository.  
This keeps the project clean and focused only on the files that matter for version control.
editor/review is the branch I use to check my work, fix grammar or wording, and make sure everything looks good before it goes into the main branch.
There are three faeture branches have been added.
